pwd - used to find out what file directory (i.e. folder) you are currently working in

ls - used to list what files and folders are located within the directory you are currently in

exit - used to close the command line terminal

mkdir - used to create a new directory

cp - used to copy a file

hostname - used to find out the 'name' of your computer

cd - used to change to a different directory

cat - used to 'stream' a file, or display the data contained within the file (e.g. the text contained in a .txt document)

man - when used before a command it tells you what the command does and how to use it
